# agu24-gplates-gmt

Scripts and notebooks (where possible) related to the AGU 2024 talk: **Plate Tectonic Reconstructions: GPlates, GMT, Python, and the Path Ahead** (Nicky Wright, Sabin Zahirovic, John Cannon, Xiaodong Qin, Ben Mather, Maria Seton, R. Dietmar MÃ¼ller).

## Includes:
- `age_grid_animations.ipynb`: notebook to download and get plate reconstruction data using GPlately, and plot using pyGMT
- `paleobathymetry.ipynb`: notebook to download and get plate reconstruction data using GPlately, calculate paleobathymetry using [pybacktrack](https://github.com/EarthByte/pyBacktrack), and plot using pyGMT
- `gplates_animation.sh`: bash script that uses GMT to plot spinning globe showcasing various things exported out of GPlates (reconstructed features, velocities, reconstructed rasters), and age/paleobathymetry grids

Also mentioned in talk:
- [Predicting Slab Flux example using GPlately](https://gplates.github.io/gplately/v1.3.0/08-PredictingSlabFlux.html)
- [Example of fluxes across Andes latitudes through time from Seton et al. 2023](https://github.com/siwill22/Deconstructing-Plate-Tectonic-Reconstructions/blob/v0.1/Figure5/AndesFluxes.ipynb)
